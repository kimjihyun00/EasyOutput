      <DiaryContent className="body1">
        I just wanted to <em>lift my mood</em>, so I decided to grab a coffee.
        I'd been wanting to visit that caf√© ever since I discovered it. They
        serve Siphon Coffee, and I really wanted to try it. <br />
        <br />
        It was really nice. It was quiet and the music was so calm. I think this
        place is good to focus on something. Oh! They have a rewards system, and
        they give out a lot of points.
        <br />
        <br />
        Did you see that Siphon Coffee maker? It was used to make my coffee. The
        coffee bean that I had was really good, and I wanted to buy it. And I
        wanted to come with my mom someday. She loves coffee.
